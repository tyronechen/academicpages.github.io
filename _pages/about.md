PhD student in computational biology in the [Bioinformatics Lab at Monash University](https://bioinformaticslab.erc.monash.edu/).

I am working on harmonising data from multiple modalities to build regulatory and functional signatures of a biological process. [This review contains some background information](https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giaa064) for this project.
